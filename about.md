Once upon a time, inside a country called Nepal, in the shadow of the Himalayas, there was a boy who asked way too many questions, making his parents and teachers mad. Then, as the years went by he stopped asking silly questions. And started asking sillier ones - questions to do with life, death, coffee, semicolons and such.

Welcome to my special corner of the internet (no more special than any other, of course). I try and post my writings here instead of hiding them in some dark place like a misaligned creature a deranged scientist invents. If it becomes helpful to you, Reader, in some way, for entertainment or otherwise - then that's great as well. I tend to be a synthesist, trying to match ideas across different domains and see which ones stick.

I'm an electronics and communications engineer (WIP) and developer from [Lalitpur, Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalitpur,_Nepal). I'm currently studying at [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](http://ioe.edu.np/) in my 4th year.

My primary programming language is *Python*. I am also interested in backend, data science and machine learning. A lot of my time is spent on trying to get my embedded electronics projects to work. Other techincal interests include: GIS/RS, amateur radio, linux system administration and LaTeX.

English is my second language, albeit the one I engage mostly with. I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/p2anmol) as much as I can, and (very occasionally) write at [Medium](https://medium.com/@p2anmol).

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) with the template [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo) and hosted at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
