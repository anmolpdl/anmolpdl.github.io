Hello! I'm an electronics and communications engineer (WIP) and developer from [Lalitpur, Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalitpur,_Nepal). I'm currently studying at [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](http://ioe.edu.np/) in my 4th year.

My primary programming language is *Python*. I am also interested in backend, data science and machine learning. A lot of my time is spent on trying to get my embedded electronics projects to work. Other techincal interests include: GIS/RS, amateur radio, linux system administration and LaTeX.

English is my second language, albeit the one I engage mostly with. I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/p2anmol) as much as I can, and (very occasionally) write at [Medium](https://medium.com/@p2anmol).

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) with the template [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo).
